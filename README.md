<h3>Use</h3>
<p>go to <a href="https://project.charlesmiske.com/character">HERE</a> and see list of characters from LOTR.<br>Type at least a partial name and submit. If there no results currently shows empty grid. If it fails you'll get a laravel error message.<br><b>To Do:</b>catch no results with a message, and catch error with a message.<br>
currently if you attempt a search less than ten or so seconds apart it will gripe at you.</p>

<p>NOTE: This was an educational experience, as I have relied somewhat heavily on frontend, devops and IT for much of my infrastructure, so had to replicate as much as I could in the time given. I was unable to complete the entire project, but was able to mess around with models, migrations, controllers and routes, which are slightly different in C#/.NET but the same idea. I'm still confident that on the job I would be able to come up to speed quickly, as I stated in the interview. Having an existing codebase to parse and study and emulate is a huge benefit in acquiring new skills quickly. Thanks for the opportunity to explore this option, and I enjoyed the learning process.</p>

<h3>History.</h3>
<p><b>Aug 1:</b> receieved assignment. <br>reviewed. seems very front-end heavy.

Will be unable to install and configure and use JS frameworks<br>
What is the MVP about this project?<br>
Something to keep in mind is that the LOTR API has very small limits, so it's not like we could hit it to update on every character entered in the search<br>
</p>

<b>Aug 4:</b><br>
Added migrations for list db tables.<br>
There is an index on list.name but not implemented in code yet<br>
