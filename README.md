<h3>Use</h3>
<p>go to <a href="project.charlesmiske.com/character">HERE</a> and see list of characters from LOTR.<br>Type at least a partial name and submit. If there no results currently shows empty grid. If it fails you'll get a laravel error message.<br><b>To Do:</b>catch no results with a message, and catch error with a message.<br>
currently if you attempt a search less than ten or so seconds apart it will gripe at you.</p>

What is the MVP about this project?<br>
Something to keep in mind is that the LOTR API has very small limits, so it's not like we could hit it to update on every character entered in the search<br>
